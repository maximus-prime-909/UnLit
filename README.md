# UnLit
## FPS Game
**Unlit** is an FPS game where the character has limited visibility under their control. Based in an apocalyptic world where the character needs to reach their base, crossing the dark, puzzled alleys which are filled with enemies. The game focuses on giving the player another dimension of control over their vision while also crippling this very crucial aspect of an interactive first person video game to add another level of difficulty and fun. With the limited number of Flare Gun bullets, the player has to strategize his/her moves based on the map for successfully completing the level.
